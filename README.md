# Cookie | Look for Recipes

Use [Cookie](https://imarijoyborda.com/cookie/) to look for recipes given one main ingredient.

My motivation: I made this for my friend who loves to cook but doesn't always know what to cook! Now he can use this site to view recipes involving the hero ingredient he has in mind.

## How To Use
Enter a keyword (usually a main ingredient) in the textbox then press `Submit`. A carousel of available recipes will be shown. The carousel will automatically move every three seconds, but the results can also be navigate manually by pressing on the left (to see the previous recipe) or on the right (to see the next recipe).

For each recipe, a picture of the dish is shown as well as the list of ingredients and the step-by-step instruction on how to make it.

## How It's Made
This uses [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com). Tech used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/chef" title="chef icons">Chef icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>

## Future Improvements
There are still lots that need to be improved in this web application. Some plans are:
* Improve responsivenes
* Improve implementation of carousel
* Improve UI
* Show more info on each dish/recipe

Contributions are also very welcome! Just issue a pull request.
